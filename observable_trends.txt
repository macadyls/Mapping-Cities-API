Obsverable Trends
------------------------------------------------------

1. There was a concave down shape in the City Latitude vs. Max Temperature (09/18/2021) scatter plot suggesting that maximum temperature drops when deviating away from the equator.
	Upon further investigation in the regression analysis for northern and southern hemispheres, there was strong negative of -0.82 and strong positive of 0.78 respectively.
	This correlations support the suggested statement: Maximum Temperature drops when deviating away from the Equator.

2. When obsevering the other regression analysis, there was almost no correlation between city latitude and other variables such as humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.

3. When observing the City Latitude vs. Humidity (09/18/2021) scatter plot, there were many cities with humidites above 60% humidity on this day.

4. Cloudiness was spread out when plotted against cloudiness, however there seem to be many cities with extreme levels of cloudiness.
	That is, many cities with maximum or close to maximum cloudiness (100%) and many cities with minimum cloudiness (0%).

5. When observing the City Latitude vs. Wind Speed (09/18/2021) scatter plot, most city windspeeds were below 20mph.
